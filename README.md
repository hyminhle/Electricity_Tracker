Project Overview
The Electricity Visualizer and Analyzer is a real-time tool designed to help users, particularly energy companies like SLB, track, analyze, and visualize electricity consumption data across multiple facilities. The tool integrates a variety of data visualization techniques, such as graphs, calendars, and interactive heat maps, to provide users with actionable insights into their energy usage patterns. The goal is to support energy management, efficiency improvements, and regulatory compliance by offering an intuitive and customizable interface that caters to different user roles such as engineers, managers, and executives.

Key Features
Line Graph Comparer and Graphs Overlay

Visualize and compare energy usage data over different periods.
Easily overlay data sets for in-depth analysis.
Interactive Maps / Heat Maps

Interactive heat maps allow users to view energy consumption across multiple buildings and locations.
Visual indicators (color-coded) highlight areas of high, moderate, and low energy usage.
Consumption Calendar for Days & Months

Track energy consumption over time using a calendar interface.
Compare daily, weekly, or monthly trends to identify patterns and anomalies.
System Performance Dashboards

Centralized dashboards that display real-time and historical energy data.
Customizable reports for users to generate insights and share with management.
Customizable Alerts for Outliers

Set thresholds for consumption, with alerts for over or under-consumption.
Receive notifications when energy usage exceeds set limits, helping users take immediate action.
Data Import Integration (CSV/Excel/SQL)

Import energy data from external sources to produce visualizations and reports.
Seamlessly integrate with existing systems for data consistency.
Target Users
Grid Engineers: Monitor real-time energy consumption, compare historical data, and ensure system performance aligns with expectations.
Facility Managers: Track energy usage across multiple facilities and generate reports for decision-making.
Executives: View high-level energy consumption trends and insights to guide corporate energy strategies.
Environmental Managers: Ensure energy usage is aligned with sustainability goals by tracking energy footprints and performance metrics.
